I am a postdoctoral fellow at Simons at Berkeley hosted by Prof. [Umesh Vazirani](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/). I did my PhD in Computer Science at Columbia University advised by Prof. [Henry Yuen](https://www.henryyuen.net/). My research is focused on the interplay between quantum information and optimization as it relates to noncommutative polynomials, approximation algorithms, and hardness results.
